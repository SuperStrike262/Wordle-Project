# Wordle-Project



This program's purpose is to create a word guessing game. The word will be randomly generated from a file of 100 words. All words are 5-letter. The program will ask the user to enter a 5-letter word to try and guess our secret word. There only can be 6 attempts. If the user enter a word that has more or less than 5 letters, then an error message will appear. If gueesed correctly or the 6 attempts were all used, the game will ask to replay or end the session
